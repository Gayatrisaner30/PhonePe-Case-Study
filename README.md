# PhonePe Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores and analyzes transaction data from PhonePe, India's leading digital payments platform. The goal is to derive insights on regional usage patterns, volume trends, and other relevant metrics to better understand how digital transactions vary across Indian states.

## 📊 Project Overview

Digital payments are rapidly growing in India, and PhonePe is one of the major contributors. This analysis provides visual and statistical insights into PhonePe’s transaction data, helping us understand:

- Total transaction volumes and values across different states.
- Trends over time (monthly, quarterly).
- Most active states in terms of digital payments.
- Comparative regional performance.

## 📁 Files

- `PhonePe.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the data analysis and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Top Performing States**: Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh consistently show the highest transaction volumes and values.
- **Transaction Value Growth**: There is a steady increase in digital payment adoption year-on-year, especially post-2020.
- **Geographic Disparity**: Southern and Western states lead in digital payment penetration compared to the Northeast and some Northern states.
- **Low Volume States**: Regions like Mizoram, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh record the lowest transaction values, indicating a digital divide.
- **Urban vs Rural**: Metro cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi significantly contribute to transaction volumes due to higher smartphone penetration and awareness.

## 📌 Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- State-wise analysis of transaction volumes and values
- Time series visualizations
- Regional comparisons through bar and line charts
- Identification of top-performing regions
